            <h2>History</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>White water rafting, more than just an adventurous sport, is a journey through history and nature. Its roots stretch back to ancient civilizations that used rafts to navigate rivers, but it was in the 20th century that the activity began to take the form we know today. Following World War II, the availability of surplus inflatable rafts allowed pioneers like John D. Yost and Walt Blackadar to explore canyons and wild rivers in the United States. These expeditions, filled with courage and an exploratory spirit, marked the beginning of a new era. As popularity grew, so did innovations in equipment and techniques, making rafting an increasingly accessible and safe activity. Adventurers began seeking more challenging rivers, and the thrill of navigating untamed rapids became a shared passion worldwide. Rafting transformed into a way to connect with nature, a personal challenge, and an unforgettable experience.</p>

From early makeshift rafts to modern high-tech equipment, each step has been driven by the passion to explore the wildest corners of the planet. Rivers, with their power and beauty, have been the stage for countless stories of bravery and camaraderie. Guides, true connoisseurs of the river's secrets, became key figures, passing on their expertise and ensuring the safety of adventurers. Today, rafting is much more than a sporting activity; it's a transformative experience that challenges boundaries and creates lasting memories.
